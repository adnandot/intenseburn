				1. What is the importance of the fitness test?				</div>
				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>Fitness testing is the best way for you to be able to track your progress physically. As you get fitter and stronger you’ll be able to perform more reps. Also, our algorithms use the results from the fitness tests to deliver the workouts at the right intensity according to which level you are at. This way we find you will get the best results, however fit you are.</p>

				4. Do I need any equipment to do the workouts? 				</div>
				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>You don’t need any equipment, all you need is yourself. It is also recommended that you keep a towel and a bottle of water with you when you do the workouts.</p>

				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>If you are serious about getting results you should be aiming to complete a workout a minimum of 3 times per week. If you can do more than that, great! Mornings and lunch times are best but again it’s all about you so whatever time you can fit it in, put intense burn to work.</p>

				6. With other workouts, the more you do them the easier they get. Is this the same with Intense Burn?				</div>
				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>Our bodies are very smart and complex therefore always looking to improve. It’s important to keep challenging yourself and pushing to working harder. When taking the fitness tests, the workouts will automatically change as you are getting fitter. With other workouts, you keep doing the same DVD hence they get easier, which is something you will not experience with ours. We also have regular updates in workouts so you’ll be far from bored.</p>

				7. When can I expect to see results?				</div>
				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>The question I’m going to ask you is did you stick to your diet or give up after a week or two?? If you follow the steps and stick to a new diet/eating plan you will see results. Within 45 days you will see a huge difference as long as you stick to Intense Burn.</p>

				10. I do not have a lot of time to cook. Do the recipes require a lot of preparation and cooking time?				</div>
				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>The vast majority of our recipes are designed to be very time-efficient, as we know that most people lead busy lives. Having said this, we’ve allowed for some recipes which may a bit more elaborate or suitable for cooking in large quantities, allowing for you to freeze them for another day.</p>
<p>Of course, all the food we recommend is cooked from scratch, and it does take slightly longer than putting a ready meal into a microwave. Planning is going to be crucial, and the benefits you’ll experience will be well worth a little bit more time and effort, we promise!</p>

				11. What are the differences between the three goals?				</div>
				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>All three plans are designed around sound nutritional principles. What this means? The recipes are highly nutritious, with a great balance of all the macronutrients, i.e. protein, fats and carbohydrates. They are low glycaemic load (GL), which means that they will benefit your metabolism by reducing cravings and encouraging fat burning. Now for differences between the</p>
<p>The ‘Weight Loss’ plan:<br>
Limits total daily calories to around 1,500 for women and 2,000 for men. As a moderately restricted calorie programme, you may want to follow this for a set amount of time to get started (say 1-3 months), before moving up to the ‘Lean muscle’ programme.</p>
<p>The ‘Lean Muscle’ plan:<br>
This food plan is calculated to deliver your recommended daily allowance of calories &ndash; 2,000 for women and 2,500 for men, so you will find that it’s easier to sustain than the calorie restricted ‘weight loss’ plan. The advantage of this plan is that apart from being sustainable for the rest of your life, it is nutritionally designed to support lean muscle, as well as fat burning.</p>
<p>The ‘Bulk Muscle’ plan:<br>
This plan contains a higher overall proportion of protein, to allow for muscle repair with an increased exercise programme. The overall proportion of nutrients is still calculated to encourage fat burning, although of course as you’d expect, you’ll be increasing your muscle weight.</p>

				<div class="title-faq-single">
				12. Is the nutritional plan going to help me to lose weight?				</div>
				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>This depends which goal you choose, and what your starting weight is. If you start off overweight, and you follow the meal plan, then yes, you can expect to lose weight. It’s also important not to think of ‘weight’ as the be all and end-all… if you increase your lean muscle mass whilst also burning fat, then your body shape will improve, but your weight may only drop slightly or even stay the same.</p>
<p>If you increase muscle, then this is helping you to burn more fat (even while you sleep) and look amazing in your jeans. Weight is just the number on the scales, which no-one else sees!</p>

				13. I am a really bad cook, how easy are the recipes to follow?				</div>

				14. Due to my religious beliefs, I do not eat certain foods. Can I still use Intense Burn?				</div>
				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>Absolutely. We’ve created a wide selection of recipes with different ingredients, and from the start, you’ll have a wide choice of options for each meal, so there will always be an option for you. Moreover, you can easily switch an ingredient for another. So for example if a recipe contains beef, and you cannot eat beef, then you could switch for chicken or lamb.</p>

				15. What is the nutritional approach based on and is it scientific?				</div>
				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>Our nutritional approach is based on the latest scientifically validated nutritional research, and our meal plans are designed by qualified nutritionists. The approach we use is not focused on ‘dieting’ but rather on adopting long term habits which create a healthy and lean body by optimising the body’s own metabolism.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the meal plans we recommend contain a high level of nutrients, including lean protein, complex carbohydrates, fibre, healthy fats and a high proportion of plant foods.</p>
<p>Our recipes are low glycaemic load (GL), which means that the balance of macronutrients (protein, carbs and fats) will benefit your metabolism by reducing cravings and encouraging fat burning.</p>

				16. Is the nutritional programme safe for everyone?				</div>
				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>Our meal plans contain an ideal balance of nutrients for healthy individuals and are extremely safe and beneficial for most people. Some exceptions may be certain medical conditions, which require a very specific diet (for example, conditions that affect the kidneys, or liver). If you do suffer from a specific health condition, please check with your Doctor that it is appropriate for you to follow the meal plan.</p>
<p>Another caution we would add is that, if you are allergic to certain foods, then of course you must avoid eating them when included in our meal plans and choose one of the alternatives instead.</p>
<p>Our recipes highlight four of the most common allergens: gluten, dairy, eggs and nuts, however the list of potential allergens is infinite as each individual may react to different foods. It is your responsibility to check the list of ingredients for specific allergens when making a recipe.</p>

				17. How long should I follow the nutrition plan for?				</div>
				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>If you have the chosen the ‘Weight Loss’ programme, then we recommend setting yourself a given amount of time, say 1 &ndash; 3 months, and then moving to the ‘Lean Muscle’ programme. The ‘Lean Muscle’ and ‘Bulk Muscle’ programmes are designed to be followed for as long as you like. In fact, we strongly recommend you carry on eating this way for the rest of your life.</p>

				18. Can I have cheat days?				</div>
				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>Yes. Our aim is to help you adopt healthy eating habits for you to see the long term benefits. It’s important for you to do this at your own pace and in a way that feels manageable for you.</p>
<p>One cheat day a week can be just the release you need to keep you on track for the long term.</p>
<p>Having said this, of course, what you take out of the programme will depend on what you put into it, and you are in control of this balance.</p>

				19. What is the purpose of the fasting days?				</div>
				<div class="text-faq-single">
				<p>Intermittent fasting has many scientifically proven benefits. Our fasting days are not total, they are simply restricted to around 500 Kcal, and you have the option to include them once or twice a week (as long as you are not already on the restricted calorie ‘Weight Loss’ plan).</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of intermittent fasting:</p>
<p>It triggers a sharp increase in human growth (HGH) hormone, commonly referred to as “the fitness hormone”, which helps us to maintain health, fitness and longevity. HGH promotes muscle growth, and boosts fat loss by revving up the metabolism.<br>
It helps normalise hormones involved in hunger and metabolism (like insulin and ghrelin)<br>
It helps improve your gut flora, known to play a decisive part in health<br>
It lowers triglyceride levels<br>
It reduces inflammation<br>
Choosing to do one or two days of fasting a week will really reset your metabolism and fast track your results, leading to much faster fat burning. Whether you try it just once, or decide to do it for one month, or for ever, it’s worth giving it a go.<br>
Just make sure you take it easy on fasting days and avoid any strenuous exercise.</p>
